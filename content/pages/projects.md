		<span class="port-desc">
			A work in progress visualization language of time travel in media. I'm interested in how timelines branch and, occassionally, reconverge. I intend to port the project to D3 with a slim syntax for defining time hops and moves. Art below is an Illustrator preview.

##Wedding Graphic Design

<div class="portfolio-piece">
<div class="port-sidebar">
		
		<span class="port-desc">
			I got married in 2012 and we wanted to do as much of the work ourselves as possible. I designed the invitation as a z-fold card. The card is designed to evoke a mid-century nostalgia, but combines graphic hallmarks stretching back into the 1940s. The map is the card's centerpience and I mixed useful (and accurate) geographic information with a whimsical aesthetic.
