## Professional Experience

### Sleepy Giant Entertainment
<aside class="resume_image" id="sleepy_giant"></aside>
#### VP, Product Architecture <br/><span class="dates">(1/2009 - Present)</span>

Over the last year I have built the second generation <em>Platform As A Service product</em>. OpsEngine provides a single point solution for <em>accounts, economy management and gaming analytics</em>. OpsEngine is currently used by multiple mobile and PC titles. 

I have helped to grow the business from 12 to 100 and transition from a services to product-driven organization. A big part of this achievement was built by my business development efforts. One recent example is <em>Zenimax Online’s Elder Scrolls Online</em>. They needed help building the game’s <em>Account Management, e-commerce and subscription software</em>. I pitched our solution and services to executive and middle management. The launch was a success and the relationship continues to grow as the game passes <em>750,000 subscribers</em>. In addition to Zenimax I sold into <em>Activision</em>, <em>Disney</em>, <em>Ubisoft</em>, <em>THQ</em> and many independent studios.

<em>Disney Interactive</em> had a vision for a connective service experience deployed with each of their <em>Marvel</em> games called <em>Marvel XP</em>. I worked with their producers to flesh out the ideas and design a product that would work on <em>Facebook</em>, <em>iOS</em>, <em>Android</em> and console. I built a working HTML prototype with <em>Axure RP</em>. This exercise refined the product pitch and helped secure project funding. Once approved, our project scope increased to include full application development. MXP launched with <em>Avengers Alliance</em> on Facebook, reaching <em>1M+ monthly active users</em>.



### Championship Gaming Series (DirecTV)
<aside class="resume_image" id="cgs"></aside>
#### Director of Product Development <br /><span class="dates">(1/2008 - 12/2008)</span>

I joined CGS in its second year. We needed to build, understand and engage our user base. An early initiative was to <em>redesign and focus</em> the site. The new design provided access to deep league statistics and supported an aggressive content strategy.

CGS needed more visibility into its user base, so I built a set of dashboards in <em>Crystal Reports</em> and <em>MySQL</em>. With this data we better understood user profiles and engagement patters. This data proved useful to Marketing and our sponsorship partners.

I designed a tournament system for amateur real-money competition. The most successful application of this was a <em>World of Warcraft</em> tournament, streamed live to <em>70,000 viewers</em>.

### Emotive Communications
#### Senior Manager, Products  <br /><span class="dates">(6/2007 - 12/2007)</span>

I joined Emotive to manage the RingJacker product, a new product category in mobile. The entry point was a push-oriented ringtone (I control what you hear when I call you). The long-term vision was to build a rich presence system for networked mobile devices. As a proof of concept, we built on <em>Skype’s</em> plugin platform. I built <em>graph models</em> to understand community dynamics and study vitality and adoption. The result of this inquiry helped me focus the roadmap and identify passionate community advocates.

### Infospace (Voltari)

#### Program Manager  <br /><span class="dates">(8/2006 - 6/2007)</span>

In this role I evaluated new opportunities and drafted proposals where there was a potential fit. Each proposal estimated fit, budget and timeline. I presented my findings to executive management for final evaluation. 

#### Production Team Manager  <br /><span class="dates">(8/2004 - 8/2006)</span>

Infospace partnered with Sprint to launch a streaming video app for feature phones. I specified the channel scheduling tool. This web app allowed us to publish content with territorial restrictions and windowed availability. It provided a single interface for ingestion, decoration and scheduling.
