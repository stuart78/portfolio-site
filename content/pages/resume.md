## Professional Experience

### Sleepy Giant Entertainment
<aside class="resume_image" id="sleepy_giant"></aside>
#### VP, Product Architecture <br/><span class="dates">(1/2009 - Present)</span>

Over the last year I have been building the second generation <em>Platform As A Service</em> offering. OpsEngine provides a single point solution for <em>accounts, economy management and gaming analytics</em>. This generation of the platform is currently used by <a href="http://tiltingpoint.com/">Tilting Point</a> and <a href="http://www.robotentertainment.com/">Robot Entertainment</a>, serving mobile and PC games.

At Sleepy Giant I have helped to grow the business from 12 to 100 and transition from services to product. A big part of this achievement has been built on my <em>business development</em> efforts, one recent example is <a href="http://www.zenimax.com/">Zenimax Online’s</a> <a href="http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/">Elder Scrolls Online</a>. They needed a group to build a large part of the game’s <em>CRM, e-commerce and subscription</em> software. I, along with the software architect, was able to articulate how Sleepy Giant would step in and build the necessary services. The relationship with Zenimax continues to grow with Sleepy Giant expanding its role as the game grows past <em>750,000 subscribers</em>.

In 2011 <em>Disney</em> had a vision of a connective service experience deployed with each of their Marvel games called <em>Marvel XP</em>. I worked with their producers to flesh out the ideas and design a product that would work on Facebook, mobile and console. I built a functional prototype for MXP using <em>Axure</em> that grounded our ideas in something tangible and helped get sell the product internally. Once approved, I guided the transition to production-grade product, designing the content plan and integrations into other Disney services. MXP launched with Avengers Alliance on Facebook, reaching <em>1M+ monthly active users</em>. 

A theme in many of my engagements through Sleepy Giant has been multiple, partially compatible pre-existing systems and a client struggling to bring them all together. <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/">The Pokémon Company</a> faced exactly this problem while bringing their <em>trading card game</em> online. Through an early consultative phase, I helped everybody get on the same page about who was responsible for what and how they could bring everything together to release a complete and fully integrated experience. This work lead to a long-term development and design contract in which we provided technology, developers and comprehensive project management.

When Vogster Entertainment was launching CrimeCraft I built an <em>analytics toolset</em> for exploring game and economy balance. After launch, we helped migrate the game from traditional retail + subscription to <em>free to play</em> and I modeled out various scenarios extrapolating from this data. This excercise was essential to the game's smooth transition.

### Championship Gaming Series (DirecTV)
<aside class="resume_image" id="cgs"></aside>
#### Director of Product Development <br /><span class="dates">(1/2008 - 12/2008)</span>

I joined CGS in its second year. They had rushed out a website on the heels of a televised tournament and were struggling to build, understand and engage their userbase. The essential first step was to overhaul and focus the site. A new design provided access to deep <em>league statistics</em>, supported an aggressive <em>content strategy</em> and better served the needs of league sponsors. 

Through a series of seasonal events and participatory initatives we doubled the registerd userbase and extended engagement to a broader set of users. I designed a <em>tournament system</em> for amateur real-money competition culminating in <em>World of Warcraft</em> tournament, streamed live to <em>~70,000 viewers</em>. 

CGS had very little visibility into its customer base, so soon after joining I built a set of dashboards in <em>Crystal Reports</em> and <em>MySQL</em>. This analysis helped me articulate a clear set of personas to our advertising partners and understand user behavior. 

### Emotive Communications
#### Senior Manager, Products  <br /><span class="dates">(6/2007 - 12/2007)</span>

I joined Emotive to manage the RingJacker product, a new product category in mobile. The entry point was a <em>push-oriented ringtone</em> (I control what you hear when I call you), but the long term vision to build a rich <em>presence</em> system for networked mobile devices. As a proof of concept, we first built the product as a Skype plugin. This provided to be a modestly sized but active community for analysis. I built a graph model with <em>MySQL</em> and <em>Excel</em> to understand community dynamics and study how RingJacker spread within a group. I used the result of this inquiry to prioritize product sharing incentives within the roadmap and to engage with community leaders to get their input on our approach.

### Infospace (Voltari)

#### Program Manager  <br /><span class="dates">(8/2006 - 6/2007)</span>

In late 2006 I transitioned from the video team to a new role overseeing the client services <em>business development</em> pipeline. I evaluated opportunities and scoped workable responses where there was a potential fit. Projects included many carrier promotions as well as innovating ways to monetize at live events and locations. 

#### Production Team Manager  <br /><span class="dates">(8/2005 - 8/2006)</span>

I spent this year running <em>mobile video production</em>. Infospace had partnered with Sprint to launch a streaming video app for several feature phones. I defined the production process for content onboarding and specced the channel scheduling admin tools. This web app allowed us to publish content rotations on multiple channels with territorial restrictions and windowed availability. It provided a single interface to ingest transcoded content, add metadata and schedule the broadcast feed.  

#### Content Manager  <br /><span class="dates">(6/2004 - 8/2005)</span>

I curated audio, image and game catalogs for <em>AT&T</em>, <em>T-Mobile</em> and <em>Sprint</em> mobile content storefronts. Each week I would analyze internal customer purchase behavior and the Billboard charts in order to properly merchandise the catalog. My merchandising increased sales within curated categories by 20%. I worked closely with Marketing to create seasonal and evergreen promotions.
