<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<h3>Sleepy Giant Entertainment</h3>
<p><aside class="resume_image" id="sleepy_giant"></aside></p>
<h4>VP, Product Architecture <span class="dates">(1/2009 - Present)</span></h4>
<p>My role has shifted over the years, helping to grow the business from 12 to 100 and transition from services to product. I’ve done a lot of service and product sales, one recent example is Zenimax Online’s Elder Scrolls Online. They needed a group to build a large part of the game’s CRM And commerce software. I, along with the software architect, was able to articulate how Sleepy Giant would step in and build the necessary services. The relationship with Zenimax continues to grow with Sleepy Giant expanding its role. </p>
<p>Most of my time presently is spent designing our second generation Platform As A Service offering. OpsEngine provides a single point solution for accounts, economy management and gaming analytics. This generation of the platform is currently used by Tilting Point and Robot Entertainment, serving multiple mobile and PC titles. </p>
<p>A theme in many of my engagements through Sleepy Giant has been multiple, partially compatible pre-existing systems and a client struggling to bring them all together. The Pokémon Company faced exactly this problem while bringing their trading card game online. Through an early consultative phase, I helped everybody get on the same page about who was responsible for what and how they could bring everything together to release a complete and fully integrated experience. This work lead to a long-term development and design contract in which we provided technology, developers and comprehensive project management.</p>
<p>In 2011 Disney had a vision of a connective service experience deployed with each of their Marvel games called Marvel XP. I worked with their producers to flesh out the ideas and design a product that would work on Facebook, mobile and console. I built a functional prototype for MXP using Axure that grounded our ideas in something tangible and helped get sell the product internally. Once approved, I guided the transition to production-grade product, designing the content plan and integrations into other Disney services. MXP launched with Avengers Alliance on Facebook, soon followed by Avengers Assemble for iOS and Android. </p>
<h3>Championship Gaming Series (DirecTV)</h3>
<h4>Director of Product Development <span class="dates">(1/2008 - 12/2008)</span></h4>
<p>I joined CGS in its second year. They had rushed out a website on the heels of a televised tournament and were struggling to build, understand and engage their userbase. One essential first step was to overhaul and focus the site. The new design provided access to deep league statistics, supported an aggressive content strategy and better served the needs of league advertisers. We launched the new site in phases, testing and improving as we went.</p>
<p>Through a series of seasonal events and participatory initatives we consistently grew the community and extended engagement. I designed a tournament system for amateur real-money competition culminating in World of Warcraft tournament, streamed live to ~70,000 viewers. </p>
<p>When I joined there was very little understanding of the site's userbase. I built a set of analytics dashboards to better learn about our customers and identify community sentiment. We were able to use this data to articulate a clear set of personas to our advertising partners and better engage our audience.  </p>
<h3>Emotive Communications</h3>
<h4>Senior Manager, Products  <span class="dates">(6/2007 - 12/2007)</span></h4>
<p>I joined Emotive to manage the RingJacker product, which we hoped would introduce product category in mobile. The entry point was a push-oriented ringtone, and we'd use the platform to build a rich presence system for networked mobile devices. As a proof of concept, we first built the product as a Skype plugin. That was not much of a platform, but by analyzing the customerbase and the spread of the plugin, I was able to demonstrate high product virality and identify the most important product advocates.</p>
<h3>Infospace (Voltari)</h3>
<h4>Program Manager  <span class="dates">(8/2006 - 6/2007)</span></h4>
<p>In late 2006 I transitioned from the video team to a new role overseeing the client services business development pipeline. I worked with internal stakeholders and external customer prospects to craft and evaluate service proposals, often carrier-driven promotional projects. </p>
<h4>Production Team Manager  <span class="dates">(8/2005 - 8/2006)</span></h4>
<p>I spent the next year building a team for managing our early mobile video production needs. Infospace had partnered with Sprint to launch a streaming video app for several feature phones. I drafted the production process for content onboarding and product managed the channel schedulign admin tools. The channel scheduling app allowed us to publish content rotations on multiple channels with territorial restrictions and timed playlists. It provided a single interface to ingest transcoded content, add relevant metadata and schedule it for broadcast.  </p>
<h4>Content Manager  <span class="dates">(6/2004 - 8/2005)</span></h4>
<p>I curated audio, image and game catalogs for AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Sprint mobile content storefronts. Each week I would study trends in our sales as well as the Billboard charts in order to properly merchandise the catalog. Additionally, I worked closely with Marketing to create seasonal and evergreen promotions. </p>
